# Homework 4!

## 1, Taco cat
Entering the lonely house with my wife  
I saw him for the first time  
Peering furtively from behind a bush --   
Blackness that moved,  
A shape amid the shadows,  
A momentary glimpse of gleaming eyes  
Revealed in the ragged moon.  
A closer look (he seemed to turn) might have  
Put him to flight forever --  
I dared not  
(For reasons that I failed to understand),  
Though I knew I should act at once.  

I puzzled over it, hiding alone,  
Watching the woman as she neared the gate.  
He came, and I saw him crouching  
Night after night.  
Night after night  
He came, and I saw him crouching,  
Watching the woman as she neared the gate.

Doppelganger by James A. Lindon is an amazing example of palindrome at scale, did you notice that it read the same from bottom to top as it does from top to bottom?  

Now, write a program that takes a word or a sentence and determines whereather is it palindrome or not

For example: `python taco_cat.py "A nut for a jar of tuna"` would output: `yes`.


For input: `python taco_cat.py "Call me maybe"` it would output `no`.

Case and any special characters should be ignored so that `ro"Ta$t"or!?` is equal to `rotator`

Homework directory contains `palindrome_test_file.txt`with few examples and words.

## 2, Call me maybe

Write a program that given a "phone number" prints a sorted list of *all possible words* generated from a telephone keypad. The word must be in word_list.txt file.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_keypad

The program takes two arguments, a number and reads the list of words from standard input as shown in the example below:

```
python call_me_maybe.py "6502227795" < word_list.txt
```

The number can be any arbitrary positive integer that is prefixed with any number of zeros, for example:

```
00000064397623478074
97843956424
675375065703
1
```
are all valid numbers.

Thus, given `228` the program should print:


```
bat
cat
```
